*   **auth.py**: Contains JWT-based authentication utilities.
    
*   **crud.py**: Basic database operations such as creating a user and verifying credentials.
    
*   **database.py**: Configuration for database connections using SQLAlchemy.
    
*   **models.py**: SQLAlchemy models defining database tables.

Setup Instructions
------------------

### Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/talharehmanabid1999/chat_flash.git  cd chat_flash  `

### Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install dependencies:

python -m venv env  source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'env\Scripts\activate'  pip install -r requirements.txt   `

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  ALGO=HS256  ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30   `

### Initialize the Database

Run the following command to create the SQLite database:

python -c "from database import Base, engine; Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)"   `

### Run the Application

Start the application using Uvicorn:

uvicorn main:app --reload   `

### Access the Application

The application should now be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

Running Tests
-------------

To run the tests, use:

pytest 

The tests are located in the tests/ directory and include:

*   **tests/test_auth.py**: Tests for user authentication and authorization.
    
*   **tests/test_crud.py**: Tests for basic CRUD operations on the database.
    
*   **tests/test_async.py**: Tests for the main app routes.

    


Usage Instructions
------------------

### User Registration and Login

*   **Register a new user** by making a POST request to /signup with a JSON payload containing username and password.
    
*   **Log in** by sending a POST request to /token, which returns an access token.
    
*   **Access Protected Routes** using the Authorization header with the token in the format Bearer .
    

### Real-Time Chat

Connect to WebSocket at /ws/chat?token= to establish a real-time chat connection.

*   **Send messages** directly to another user by specifying their username.
    

Troubleshooting
---------------

*   **Error: No Such Table**: Ensure the database has been initialized by running Base.metadata.create\_all(bind=engine).
    
*   **Test Errors**: Verify that .env file variables are correctly set, and pytest is run from the project root.
